The app
=======================================================
Random Number Generator App Overview
This app allows you to generate a specified number of random numbers, with the option to choose any number between 0 and 1337. The first step in using the app is to select how many random numbers you want to generate.

X and Y Axis Customization
In the second step, you can define the minimum and maximum values for both the x-axis and y-axis. You can select a range between -1337 and 1337 for both axes, which allows you to define the area from which your random numbers will be sampled.

Libraries and Methods Used
Libraries: The app utilizes the shiny library for building the interface and functionality. Additionally, markdown and knitr were used to assist in rendering the content.

Challenges: I encountered some difficulties while attempting to add a second button in the main panel (next to the "random numbers" button). My original plan was to use the second button to display an about file that contains information about the methods used. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t get the about file to integrate smoothly into the app. However, it worked perfectly when tested locally. ðŸ˜Š
